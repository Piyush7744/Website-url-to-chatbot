ðŸ› MY GEARðŸ› 
This is what I use to create my content. I am not sponsored by any of these companies.
ðŸŽ¥ Recording Equipments
Canon EOS 80D
I bought it back in 2018 for my US trip and have been using it since then. If you want to buy this in 2022, go for the EOS 90D (Same camera - Updated version). This is an amazing camera given that its still working exactly like it was working when I bought it. I use it for my YouTube tutorial videos as well. I use a USB cable, EOS utility software to make videos.
View on Amazon
iPhone 13 Pro Max 256GB
I have always dreamt of buying an iPhone for myself. Back in 2021, I finally bought my first ever iPhone and its been a great phone so far. I use it for my YouTube videos and also for my Instagram stories. I also use it to take photos for my YouTube thumbnails.
View on Amazon
Lenovo 300 FHD Webcam
Sometimes I also use this Webcam to record videos. This has a great camera, and the microphone on this device is also good. This is a good webcam at its price.
View on Amazon
Blue Yeti
This is my main microphone, and I got this back in 2021. Before this, I used Snowball ICE to record the videos, but I wanted to upgrade, so I bought this microphone. I have used it for all of my videos since then. This microphone has a crisp audio quality and good noise suppression.
View on Amazon
Blue Snowball ICE
This is my secondary microphone and I got this back in 2016 when I started YouTube. I used it for all of my videos back then. This has a crisp audio quality and good noise suppression. I still use this Microphone.
View on Amazon
Boya BY-M1
This is another mic I use for my videos. I got this when I was a little tight on my budget. This microphone is what I can say is value for money. This has good audio quality and its easy to setup. But soon I stopped using it and upgraded due to its limited battery backup.
View on Amazon
Rode SmartLav+
It is a good lavalier condenser microphone, but it is a bit costly. I bought it as an upgrade to my Boya BY-M1. It is easy to setup, and sometimes I use it with my iPhone to record audio.
View on Amazon
Apple iPad Pro with Apple M1 chip 2021
I got this back on 2021. I bought it for taking notes and making videos. It is a good product altogether but I haven't used it much.
View on Amazon
ðŸ–¥ PC Specs
2021 Apple MacBook Pro (14-inch)
I purchased this in 2022 and this has been my primary laptop since then. Being a content creator this is one of my best decisions and, long story short, this laptop has never disappointed me.
View on Amazon
ASUS ROG Strix G17 (2021)
I purchased this in 2021 and this has been my primary laptop since then. I upgraded its RAM to 64GB (being a content creator) and, long story short, this laptop has never disappointed me.
View on Amazon
Intel Core i9-10900K
This is my main CPU. This beast is packed with 10 cores and 20 threads. It is a great CPU for those who want to do 4K encoding and video editing. I bought it in 2021 and it is still going strong.
View on Amazon
Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 8GB
This is my GPU. This beast is packed with 8GB of VRAM. I literally had to wait for 2 months to get this GPU back in 2021, when the GPU crisis was at its peak. I have no complaints regarding this GPU. It delivers what it promises.
View on Amazon
XPG Adata GAMMIX D30 64GB (4x16GB)
This is my RAM. At first I had only 32GB of RAM, but then I upgraded it to 64GB. This RAM runs at 3600MHz, and it is a great RAM in terms of performance.
View on Amazon
MSI MPG Z490 Gaming Plus Motherboard
This is my motherboard. I bought it for my Beast PC build and it is still going strong. This motherboard has lots of USB ports and, on top of that, it has 2 M.2 NVME slots, which is great for those who want to install 2 SSDs.
View on Amazon
Antec HCG850 Power Supply
This is my main power supply. This is packed with 850W of power and it is 80 Plus Gold certified. This is a fully modular PSU with a 135mm fan. This power supply is great for those who want to build a high-end PC.
View on Amazon
Western Digital WD SN550 1TB NVMe SSD
This is my main Storage. This is one of the best SSDs out there. It's value for money, and also this SSD is blazing fast in terms of performance. I'm a gaming person and a programmer and I can say for sure that this SSD never disappoints.
View on Amazon
Montech X1 White Case
In terms of the case, this is a great looking case. I purchased it for its good looks and good airflow too. This case is packed with 4 x 120mm fans. So far, it is a great case, and I dont have any complaints.
View on Amazon
Cooler Master MasterLiquid ML360L ARGB V2
This is my CPU cooler. This comes with 360mm radiator. In terms of cooling, this is a beast. It keeps my CPU cool even when I'm playing games. This is a great CPU cooler and I would recommend it to anyone who want to build a high end PC.
View on Amazon
TVS Gold Keyboard
This keyboard is a bit old. Honestly, I use it more because of emotions than anything else. You can buy any other mechanical keyboard, but I use it because I have been using the same one for a very long time.
View on Amazon
Zebronics Zeb-Transformer-M
This is a very nice affordable gaming mouse. At around 349 INR, it is a lot of value for money!
View on Amazon
Western Digital WD 2TB Elements
My oldest storage device (Using it since 2018) which is still working and has not yet disappointed me!
View on Amazon
ðŸ›‹ Ergonomics
Monarch Elevate Height Adjustable Table
When you are working for hours, it is recommended that you use a standing desk. I love switching between standing and sitting positions while I am working for long hours on my projects. Sitting for a long time is not good for your knees, for your spine, and for your overall posture too.
View on Amazon
Green Soul Beast Racing Edition Ergonomic Gaming Chair
Buying this was one of the best decisions. It feels amazing and very comfortable. If you can afford it you can go for it!
View on Amazon
Green soul stool
This helps when I code for long hours. This is for resting your legs while you are sitting on a chair for hours. It really helps when my leg sprains.
