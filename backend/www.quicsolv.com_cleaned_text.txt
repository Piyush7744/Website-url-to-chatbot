We had a significant and urgent request that came through this morning. Thank you and the team for responding to the banner removal. After the banner was removed, a contract for 15 new schools was signed! If it had not been removed our partner threatened to pull x2VOL from his offering. It was a tough situation so please thank the team for removing the banner from the home page. I know that this caused a delay in other items but I appreciate the response.

Aadhar Card Masking: Protecting Privacy in Accordance with Government Regulations
Aadhaar, the unique identification number issued by the Government of India, is an essential identity document for Indian citizens. However, with the increasing use of Aadhaar in various sectors, concerns about data privacy and security have become more pronounced. In response, the government has implemented regulations to ensure that Aadhaar data is protected and safeguarded.
For companies in the BFSI sector, Aadhaar is a critical component of their operations. However, they must also ensure that they comply with the regulations related to Aadhaar masking. Aadhaar masking is the process of hiding the first eight digits of Aadhaar numbers while revealing only the last four digits. This helps protect the privacy and security of individuals’ Aadhaar data, while still allowing companies to use the information for legitimate purposes.
Read ahead and get a comprehensive guide on Aadhaar masking and its regulations. We will also highlight the benefits of Aadhaar masking for companies in the BFSI sector and provide you with best practices for implementing it.

What is Aadhaar Masking?
Aadhaar masking is a process of partially hiding the first eight digits of an Aadhaar number while revealing only the last four digits. This is done to protect the privacy and security of individuals’ Aadhaar data, while still allowing companies to use the information for legitimate purposes.
Explanation of the Process:
The process of Aadhaar masking involves :
Masking First Eight Digits:
Modifying the Aadhaar number to hide the first eight digits, and only display the last four digits. This can be done manually or using automated software tools.
Masking of Eyes:
Aadhaar card also contains a photograph of the individual, which includes their eyes. Masking of eyes is necessary to protect the privacy and security of the individual, as it prevents unauthorized use of the individual’s biometric information. Biometric information such as iris and fingerprint scans can be used to identify an individual and grant access to their personal information, making it important to protect this information by masking the eyes.
Masking of QR Code:
The QR code on the Aadhaar card contains sensitive information such as the individual’s Aadhaar number, demographic details, and biometric information. Masking the QR code ensures that this information is not easily accessible to unauthorized parties. Additionally, masking the QR code helps to prevent the misuse of the Aadhaar data, as it prevents individuals from using the QR code to access or share sensitive information without the individual’s consent.
Greater convenience:
Video MER can be more convenient for policyholders or applicants who are located in remote or underserved areas, or who have mobility or transportation issues.
Reduced risk of exposure to infectious diseases:
By reviewing medical exams remotely, underwriters can reduce the risk of exposure to infectious diseases, which can be especially important during times of pandemic or other public health emergencies.
Regulations related to Aadhaar Masking
The government of India has implemented regulations related to Aadhaar masking to ensure the privacy and security of individuals’ Aadhaar data. Companies in the BFSI sector are required to comply with these regulations while using Aadhaar data for legitimate purposes.
Overview of the Regulations:
As per the guidelines provided by UIDA and the latest guidelines given on the link (
https://www.uidai.gov.in/images/Aadhaar_In_Media_22_March_2023.pdf
), companies must follow the following regulations related to Aadhaar masking:
Masking of Aadhaar numbers:
Companies must mask the first eight digits of Aadhaar numbers while revealing only the last four digits. This applies to both physical and digital Aadhaar cards.
Masking of eyes and QR code:
In addition to masking the Aadhaar number, companies must also mask the individual’s eyes and QR code on the Aadhaar card.
Consent for Aadhaar authentication:
Companies must obtain explicit consent from the individual for Aadhaar authentication. The consent must be obtained separately for each use case and cannot be obtained through coercion or misrepresentation.
Storage and protection of Aadhaar data:
Companies must store Aadhaar data securely and protect it from unauthorized access or misuse. They must also ensure that the data is not shared with unauthorized parties.
Consequences of Non-Compliance:
Non-compliance with the regulations related to Aadhaar masking can result in penalties and legal action against the company. Companies may be fined, and their license to use Aadhaar data may be revoked. Additionally, non-compliance can damage the company’s reputation and erode the trust of its customers. It is, therefore, essential for companies to comply with the regulations to protect themselves and their customers from harm.
Benefits of Aadhaar Masking for Companies:
Aadhaar masking offers several benefits to companies in the BFSI sector. It helps them to protect the privacy and security of their customers’ Aadhaar data while still using it for legitimate purposes. Here are some of the benefits of Aadhaar masking for companies:
Overview of the Benefits:
Enhanced Privacy and Security:
Aadhaar masking helps companies to protect the privacy and security of their customers’ Aadhaar data by masking sensitive information such as the first eight digits of Aadhaar numbers, eyes, and QR codes.
Improved Compliance:
Companies can comply with the regulations related to Aadhaar masking by implementing appropriate masking techniques. Compliance helps to prevent penalties and legal action against the company.

Enhance Risk Control with Videography: A Powerful Addition to VideoMER
Enhance Risk Control with Videography: A Powerful Addition to VideoMER
Welcome to the world of Videography, a transformative approach to health assessments in the insurance industry. Videography combines the precision of in-person medical examinations with the convenience and efficiency of digital technology. This innovative process not only streamlines the assessment of an insurance proposer’s health status but also establishes a new standard for accuracy and reliability in risk evaluation.
At the core of Videography is the integration of live video calls, where medical professionals conduct real-time health screenings. This process ensures that the insured or proposer is in the right state of health and mind for the assessment, paving the way for transparent and direct communication. The interaction is not just a conversation; it is a comprehensive medical examination, observed and recorded to uphold the integrity of the process.
Videography brings the Diagnostic Center to a proposer’s home, saving the hassle of travel and wait times. A certified phlebotomist arrives at the proposer’s doorstep, equipped with state-of-the-art medical tools and a commitment to compassionate care. As they guide the proposer through the procedure, every step is meticulously recorded via a secure video link. This not only assures you of a personal touch in every interaction but also allows for an unobtrusive yet thorough health examination.
From verifying identity with government-approved ID cards to conducting an ECG, from collecting a urine sample to drawing blood, every procedure is performed with the utmost professionalism and attention to detail. The result is a seamless fusion of human expertise and digital efficiency — an authentic proof the insurance company needs that the process was performed to the best.
Videography provides a panoramic view, ensuring that an insurance company has a complete and accurate understanding of a proposers medical profile. It’s not just about assessing risk; it’s about embracing innovation to provide the insurance underwriters with the best possible insurance solutions.
The Superiority of Videography Over VideoMER
The process of assessing a proposer’s health status for insurance is critical, with no room for inaccuracies or manipulation. This is where Videography’s comprehensive approach truly outperforms VideoMER. Here’s an in-depth look at the benefits of Videography:
Guaranteed Procedure Verification:
With VideoMER lacking visual confirmation, there’s uncertainty about the authenticity of the health data collected. Videography eradicates these doubts. It ensures that every step, from blood draws to urine collection, is visually recorded and monitored, eliminating the question of whether procedures were properly conducted.
Elimination of Fraud Risk:
In a VideoMER setup, there’s potential for proposers to unduly influence the phlebotomist, leading to falsified health records. Videography closes this loophole by providing live video oversight, making it virtually impossible for proposers to sway the recording of vital signs or manipulate the collection of samples. This live recording acts as a safeguard, maintaining the integrity of the data.
Transparent and Accurate Blood Draws:
One of the biggest challenges with VideoMER is ensuring that the blood sample is genuinely drawn from the proposer. Videography’s live-streamed process means there can be no substitution or deception. The phlebotomist’s actions are in full view, ensuring the blood sample’s authenticity.
Verifiable Blood Pressure Readings:
Blood pressure can fluctuate with even slight manipulations. Videography’s real-time recording prevents the proposer from influencing the phlebotomist to report incorrect readings. Each reading is taken and recorded under the watchful eye of the medical professional, assuring underwriters of its accuracy.
Data Integrity for Underwriters:
The crux of insurance underwriting is reliable data. Videography’s recorded sessions provide underwriters with an unimpeachable record of the health screening process. This level of transparency and detail offers underwriters a clear view of the proposer’s health, enabling them to make well-informed decisions. With VideoMER, the lack of visual confirmation can lead to underwriting policies based on erroneous data, a risk that Videography eliminates entirely.
The Videography Process: A Step-by-Step Overview
Videography is revolutionizing the insurance medical examination process with its meticulous and transparent approach. Here’s a detailed walk-through of the Videography process that demonstrates its thoroughness and reliability:
Step 1. Scheduling and Preparation:
The journey begins when a proposer schedules an appointment. A certified phlebotomist is then dispatched to the proposer’s location, equipped with all necessary medical instruments and a secure video recording device.
Step 2. Initial Verification:
Upon arrival, the phlebotomist confirms the identity of the proposer using government-approved ID cards, such as Aadhar or PAN, ensuring that the health data collected corresponds to the correct individual.
Step 3. Setting the Stage:
The phlebotomist prepares the equipment and ensures that the proposer is comfortable and ready for the examination. The proposer’s consent is obtained before the video recording begins, establishing a foundation of trust and transparency.
Step 4. Live Video Link:
A video link is established with a medical professional who oversees the entire process. If the proposer lacks the necessary technology, the phlebotomist assists by providing access to a device, ensuring no one is excluded from the service.
Step 5. Real-Time Observation:
As the phlebotomist conducts the medical tests, including ECG, urine sample collection, measures height, weight, blood pressure and blood draws, the medical professional watches and records each step. This live supervision prevents any discrepancies and affirms the authenticity of the test procedures and results.
Step 6. Documenting the Details:
Throughout the examination, the proposer’s vital statistics, such as weight, height, and blood pressure, are measured and verbally confirmed by the phlebotomist, with the medical professional recording these details for a clear audio-visual log.
Step 7. Identity and Document Verification:
The proposer presents their ID to the camera, allowing the system to capture and verify it against government records automatically. This step eliminates the risk of identity fraud and ensures that the medical data collected is accurately attributed.
Step 8. Completion and Reporting:
A complete VideoMER is then done by a medical professional. Once the medical assessment is complete, the doctor compiles a comprehensive health report. This report is then made available to the underwriter, providing a detailed and verified account of the proposer’s health status.
Step 9. Quality Assurance and Follow-up:
After the session, the recorded video and collected health data undergo a rigorous quality assurance check to ensure all procedures were carried out correctly and all information is accurate. Follow-up actions are taken as necessary, based on the findings of the assessment.
Videography in Action: A Real-Time Demonstration
To truly appreciate the impact and functionality of Videography, seeing it in action is invaluable. We invite you to watch our detailed demonstration video on YouTube. This visual guide provides an in-depth look at how Videography seamlessly integrates technology with medical expertise to revolutionize health assessments in the insurance sector.
Experience the Efficiency and Precision of Videography
In this video, you’ll witness the meticulous process of a Videography session, from the initial identity verification to the comprehensive medical examination conducted by our skilled phlebotomists and overseen by medical professionals via video link. Pay close attention to the real-time recording and reporting, which form the cornerstone of this innovative approach.
Not only does this demonstration highlight the procedural aspects, but it also sheds light on the human element of Videography. You’ll see the care and professionalism that goes into making each session as comfortable and informative as possible for the proposer.
By the end of the video, you’ll have a deeper understanding of why Videography is the preferred choice for accurate and transparent health screenings in the insurance industry.
In conclusion, Videography represents a significant leap forward in the realm of insurance health assessments. By marrying the precision of medical science with the advancements of digital technology, it offers an unrivaled level of accuracy, security, and convenience. This innovative approach not only enhances the integrity of the underwriting process but also provides a seamless and reassuring experience for the proposer. As we continue to embrace and refine this technology, Videography stands as a beacon of progress in the insurance industry, setting new standards for reliability and trust in health screenings. Join us in this journey towards a more transparent and efficient future in insurance health assessments, where every individual’s health story is captured accurately and respectfully.

Innovative Medical Underwriting Solutions for the Digital Age
At QuicSolv, we bring a fresh perspective to medical underwriting in life insurance, focusing on enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of health risk assessments. Our approach pivots on two key stages: medical examinations and review. Utilizing our innovative Video MER technology, we capture detailed medical histories interactively, while our advanced videography offerings ensure precise paramedical evaluations. The digitization of pathology reports from diagnostic centers completes our comprehensive data analysis, enabling us to present a holistic health profile to underwriters. This technological synergy not only streamlines the underwriting process but also elevates its precision, making QuicSolv a vanguard in the intersection of healthcare and technology in insurance underwriting.
The QuicSolv’s Medical Underwriting Assistance Process
Step 1: Video Medical Examination Reports (Video MER) with Advanced AI Quality Check
Initial Contact:
The process begins with a
Video MER
session, where applicants interact via video conference with medical professionals.
Comprehensive Data Collection:
During this session, detailed medical histories, current health status, past ailments, family health history, and lifestyle habits are discussed and recorded.
Interactive Assessment:
This interactive format ensures thorough information gathering, allowing for immediate clarifications and follow-ups.
AI-Based Quality Check:
Post-session, an AI-driven quality check is performed on the recorded video call. This advanced review process ensures that no errors – such as missed disclosures or incorrect documentation – are present, guaranteeing the integrity and accuracy of the medical examination.
Step 2: Paramedical Examination and Videography
On-site Health Checks:
A certified phlebotomist conducts on-site health checks, which are recorded using our
specialized videography services
. This includes measuring vital signs like BMI, blood pressure, waist circumference and pulse.
Secure Video Capture:
The entire examination is securely captured on video. This transparency ensures accuracy in health evaluation and builds trust in the medical underwriting process.
Step 3: Digitization and Integration of Medical Examination Data
A medical underwriter spends a lot of time analyzing pages and pages of a
pathology lab report
in the traditional setting. Digitization of these pathology reports helps reduce the turn around time in medical underwriting.
Collection of Diagnostic Data:
After the medical examination, any required blood investigation report or other diagnostic procedures are conducted. The results from these tests form a critical part of the medical underwriting data.
Digital Integration:
The results are digitized and integrated into our system. This includes converting paper-based pathology lab reports into digital formats for easy analysis and access.
Smart Reports
:
Smart Reports revolutionize medical underwriting by presenting health data in an intuitive, visual format. This advancement not only simplifies the underwriter’s task of interpreting complex medical information but also ensures accuracy in risk assessment and policy decision-making. By offering a clear, comprehensive view of an individual’s health profile,
Smart Reports
enable underwriters to make informed decisions quickly, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the medical underwriting process in the insurance sector.
Step 4: Data Analysis and Review
Holistic Health Profile Construction:
Using the collected data, we construct a comprehensive health profile of the applicant.
Advanced Analytics
:
Our advanced analytics tools assess this data, piecing together the different health indicators to form a complete picture of the applicant’s medical risk.
Final Step: Data Analysis and
Assisting Underwriting Decisions
Comprehensive Data Synthesis:
At the culmination of our process, we synthesize all the collected health data, including results from the Video MER, paramedical examinations, and digitized pathology reports, into a comprehensive health profile.
Assistance in Decision-Making:
We provide this detailed dataset to the underwriters, assisting them in making well-informed decisions. Our role is to ensure that every piece of relevant information is accurately compiled and presented for effective risk assessment.
Application of Underwriting Rules:
In cases where the underwriting team provides specific criteria, we apply these rules to streamline the underwriting process. This includes the implementation of Straight Through Processing (STP) for applications that meet predefined health parameters.
Automating Standard Cases:
By using STP, standard applications with all health parameters within range are automatically processed. This efficiency enables underwriters to concentrate their efforts on more complex cases that require detailed scrutiny.
Focus on Complex Applications:
Our technology and processes thus allow underwriters to focus on applications that are not straightforward, ensuring that each policy is underwritten with the due diligence it deserves.
Enhancing Security and Compliance: Face Match and Aadhaar Masking

TeleMER: Pioneering Digital Health Assessments in Insurance
Welcome to the foundational world of TeleMER, an innovative approach that marked the beginning of digital health assessments in the insurance industry. The term ‘MER’ stands for Medical Examination Report, a crucial part of the insurance underwriting process. TeleMER, or telephonic MER, revolutionized how these medical examinations were conducted by introducing a telephonic format, paving the way for advancements like VideoMER and Videography.
The Genesis of TeleMER:
TeleMER emerged as a solution to streamline the traditional MER process, which often involved in-person medical tests and face-to-face interviews. By shifting these interactions to a telephonic medium, TeleMER made the initial health assessment more accessible and efficient.
Understanding the MER Test:
In the context of insurance, the MER test is a comprehensive health evaluation that underwriters rely on to determine the risk profile of a proposer. It typically includes gathering medical history, current health status, and lifestyle information. TeleMER enabled these details to be collected over a phone call, bringing convenience to both the insurance company and the proposer.
TeleMER’s Role in the Insurance Process:
During a TeleMER session, trained professionals conduct a detailed interview with the proposer, asking a series of predetermined questions. These queries are designed to cover a wide range of health-related topics, ensuring that the insurer gets a clear picture of the proposer’s medical condition and risks.
The Transition to Video-based Assessments:
While TeleMER offered significant improvements over traditional methods, it had its limitations, primarily the lack of visual verification. This led to the evolution of
VideoMER
– a method that retains the thorough questioning of TeleMER but adds the crucial element of visual confirmation through video calls.
The TeleMER Process: Streamlining Health Assessments Over the Phone
1. Scheduling the Call:
The TeleMER process begins with scheduling a phone call between the insurance proposer and a trained medical professional.
This flexibility allows the proposer to choose a convenient time, thus ensuring their full attention and cooperation during the assessment.
2. Preparing for the Call:
Proposers are advised to have relevant medical information handy, such as their medical history, current medications, and any recent test results.
This preparation ensures that the call is efficient and that all necessary information is readily available.
3. Conducting the Interview:
The core of the TeleMER process is the telephonic interview. During this call, the medical professional asks a series of structured questions.
These questions cover various aspects of the proposer’s health, including medical history, lifestyle choices, and any existing conditions.
4. Gathering Detailed Information:
The interviewer carefully records the proposer’s responses, gathering comprehensive data about their health status.
This information is crucial for underwriters to accurately assess the risk associated with the insurance policy.
5. Addressing Queries and Concerns:
TeleMER also provides an opportunity for proposers to ask questions and clarify any doubts they might have about the insurance process or the health information being requested.
This two-way communication ensures transparency and builds trust between the proposer and the insurance company.
6. Documentation and Reporting:
Post-call, the information collected is meticulously documented and sent to the insurance company’s underwriting team.
This report forms the basis for evaluating the insurance application and determining policy terms.
7. Quality Assurance:
Quality checks are conducted to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information gathered during the TeleMER call.
Any discrepancies or additional requirements are addressed in follow-up communications.
Advantages and Limitations of TeleMER
TeleMER, as an early foray into digitalizing the insurance health assessment process, brought several advantages to the table while also facing certain limitations. Understanding these helps in appreciating the evolution towards more advanced methods like VideoMER and Videography.
Advantages of TeleMER:
1. Enhanced Accessibility and Convenience:
TeleMER made the medical examination process more accessible, allowing proposers to participate in the assessment from the comfort of their homes.
This convenience significantly reduced the time and effort required for both proposers and insurers, streamlining the overall process.
2. Time-Efficiency:
By eliminating the need for physical appointments, TeleMER saved considerable time for both the insurance applicants and the medical professionals.
The telephonic format allowed for quick and efficient collection of health-related information.
3. Reduced Costs:
TeleMER helped in cutting down the costs associated with in-person medical examinations, such as travel expenses and the use of medical facilities.
4. Initial Risk Assessment:
The process provided insurers with an initial understanding of the proposer’s health, aiding in the early stages of risk assessment and underwriting.
Limitations of TeleMER:
1. Lack of Visual Verification:
Unlike VideoMER or Videography, TeleMER lacked the capability to visually verify the information provided by the proposer, such as physical health indicators or identity validation.
2. Limited Scope of Health Assessment:
The telephonic interview format restricted the depth of health assessment, as it relied solely on verbal communication and self-reported information.
Certain health parameters, such as blood pressure or weight, could not be accurately measured or verified.
3. Potential for Inaccurate Reporting:
The reliance on proposers’ self-reported information raised concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the data collected.
There was a risk of misunderstanding or miscommunication during the call, leading to incomplete or erroneous health records.
4. No Real-Time Medical Testing:
TeleMER did not include any real-time medical testing, which limited its effectiveness in capturing comprehensive health data.
5. Risk of Impersonation:
A significant concern with TeleMER was the high possibility of impersonation. Without visual verification, there was no foolproof way to ensure that the person on the call was indeed the proposer, raising concerns about the integrity of the data collected.
Transition to VideoMER and Videography: Advancing Beyond TeleMER
The evolution from TeleMER to VideoMER and Videography marks a significant leap in the insurance industry’s approach to health assessments. This transition was driven by the need to overcome the limitations inherent in TeleMER and to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the MER (Medical Examination Report) process.
1. Overcoming TeleMER Limitations:
Recognizing the constraints of TeleMER, such as the lack of visual verification and the high risk of impersonation, the insurance industry sought more robust solutions. The need to ensure that the MER test means more than just a telephonic interview became apparent.
2. Introduction of VideoMER:
VideoMER emerged as a sophisticated evolution of TeleMER. It retained the comprehensive questioning inherent in the MER medical test but introduced visual elements crucial for verification. This method offered a more reliable way to conduct the MER test for insurance, as it allowed underwriters to see and interact with the proposer in real-time.
3. What is MER Test in the Context of VideoMER:
In VideoMER, the MER test involves not just a series of questions but also visual confirmation of the proposer’s identity and health status. This visual aspect significantly reduced the risk of impersonation and provided a more accurate representation of the proposer’s health.
4. Videography: A Comprehensive Approach:
Videography further expanded on the foundations laid by VideoMER. While VideoMER addressed the visual limitations of TeleMER, Videography introduced real-time medical examinations into the process. This included live recordings of medical procedures like blood draws and vital signs measurements, ensuring an even more detailed and accurate MER medical test.
5. The Significance of the Transition:
The transition from TeleMER to VideoMER and subsequently to Videography represents a paradigm shift in how MER tests are conducted for insurance purposes. These advancements not only increase the precision of health assessments but also enhance the overall trust and efficiency of the insurance underwriting process.
The journey from TeleMER to
VideoMER
and
Videography
illustrates the insurance industry’s commitment to adopting new technologies and methods. These advancements have transformed the way MER tests are conducted, offering a more holistic and reliable assessment of a proposer’s health and significantly reducing the potential for fraud. As we continue to innovate, the question ‘what is an MER test?’ evolves, reflecting the ongoing refinement of insurance health assessments.

Video MER – More intelligence with Savings
Video MER, or Video based Medical Examination Report, is a process in which insurance companies use video technology to remotely conduct medical examinations for applicants or proposers, using qualified medical professionals. This can be done through the use of video conferencing tools.
Insurance companies may use Video MER to reduce costs and improve efficiency by eliminating the need for in-person medical exams. It can also be used to quickly assess the medical condition of an applicant, which can help the company make informed decisions about coverage and sums assured.
Video MER can be especially useful for insurance companies that need to review medical exams for applicants or proposers, who are located in remote or underserved areas, or who have mobility or transportation issues that make it difficult for them to attend an in-person exam.
How effective is Video MER against Physical MER?
Video Medical Exam Report (Video MER) and Physical Medical Exam Report (Physical MER) are both methods that insurance companies use to conduct medical examinations on applicants aspiring to get insured. Both methods can be effective in certain situations, but it is important to consider the specific needs and circumstances of the policyholder or applicant when deciding which method to use.
One advantage of Video MER is that it allows insurance companies to review medical exams remotely, which can be more convenient and accessible for policyholders or applicants who are located in remote or underserved areas, or who have mobility or transportation issues. Video MER can also help to reduce the risk of exposure to infectious diseases by eliminating the need for in-person visits.
On the other hand, Physical MER may be necessary in situations where a more thorough and in-depth examination is required. For example, if a policyholder or applicant has a complex medical condition that requires a hands-on examination or specialized testing, Physical MER may be more appropriate.
In general, the effectiveness of Video MER versus Physical MER will depend on the specific needs and circumstances of the policyholder or applicant, as well as the medical condition being evaluated. Insurance companies should carefully consider these factors when deciding which method to use for reviewing medical exams.
Does Video MER help prevent the nexus between the medical professional and the proposer?
Video Medical Examination Report (Video MER) can help to reduce the potential for a nexus between a medical professional and a proposer by eliminating the need for in-person medical exams. In a Video MER process, the proposert can participate in the medical exam remotely, using a telemedicine platform or other video conferencing tool. This can help to prevent the medical professional and proposer from having direct contact, which can reduce the risk of any potential conflict of interest or influence.
It is important to note, however, that while Video MER can help to reduce the potential for a nexus between a phlebotomist and a proposer, it may not completely eliminate the risk. Insurance companies should carefully review the policies and procedures they have in place to ensure that the medical exam review process is fair, impartial, and objective.
Can recordings of video MER’s help insurance companies offer lower premiums and higher sum assured?
Video MER can also help insurance companies to make more informed decisions about coverage by providing a more comprehensive view of the policyholder or proposer’s medical condition. By reviewing medical exams in real time, insurance companies can ask questions and gather additional information as needed, which can help to provide a more accurate assessment of the policyholder or applicant’s health.
In some cases, the use of Video MER may allow insurance companies to offer lower premiums and higher sum assured to policyholders or applicants. However, the specific impact on premiums and sum assured will depend on a variety of factors, including the policyholder or proposer’s medical history, age, lifestyle, and other risk factors. Ultimately, the goal of Video MER is to provide a more efficient and effective way for insurance companies to review medical exams, rather than to directly impact premiums and sum assured.
So, would insurance companies need to store the recordings?
It is common for insurance companies to store the recordings of Video Medical Examination Reports (Video MERs) as part of their records and documentation. These recordings could then be used as a reference for future evaluations and decisions related to coverage and sums assured.
There is also a legal or regulatory requirement by IRDA (
Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India
) that mandates the retention of Video MER recordings, for a period of three years.
In addition to any legal or regulatory requirements, insurance companies may choose to store Video MER recordings for their own internal purposes, such as for quality control, training, or to support future decisions about coverage and sums assured.
It is important for insurance companies to carefully manage the storage and retention of Video MER recordings in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations, as well as their own policies and procedures. This can help to ensure the privacy and security of policyholders and applicants, as well as the integrity and reliability of the insurance company’s records.
Do Insurance Companies benefit from Video MER, and how?
Insurance Companies can benefit from Video Medical Exam Review (Video MER) in a number of ways. Some potential benefits of Video MER for underwriters include:
Increased efficiency:
Video MER allows them to review medical exams remotely, which can save time and reduce the need for in-person visits. This can help to improve the efficiency of the underwriting process.
Improved accuracy:
By reviewing medical exams in real time, doctors can ask questions and gather additional information as needed, which can help to provide a more accurate assessment of a policyholder or applicant’s health.
Reduced costs:
Video MER can help to reduce the costs associated with conducting in-person medical exams, such as travel expenses, facility rentals, and other logistics.
Greater convenience:
Video MER can be more convenient for policyholders or applicants who are located in remote or underserved areas, or who have mobility or transportation issues.
Reduced risk of exposure to infectious diseases:
By reviewing medical exams remotely, underwriters can reduce the risk of exposure to infectious diseases, which can be especially important during times of pandemic or other public health emergencies.

Advantages of AI-enhanced MER checks:
Higher accuracy in identifying health discrepancies.
Reduced manual errors and biases.
Faster processing and analysis of medical data.
Consistency across different reports and cases.
Enhanced ability to detect potential fraud or misinformation.
Leveraging AI for MER checks significantly benefits both insurance companies and policyholders by providing a more accurate and efficient review process.
How important is Face Match during a Medical Examination?
Comparing the face in an identity proof to the face in a video during a Video Medical Exam Report (Video MER) can help to reduce the risk of identity fraud. By verifying the identity of the policyholder or applicant through a face match, insurance companies can confirm that the person participating in the Video MER is indeed the individual whose identity has been provided.
However, it is important to note that a face match alone may not be sufficient to completely prevent identity fraud. There are a number of other steps that insurance companies can take to reduce the risk of identity fraud, such as verifying the authenticity of identity documents, checking for red flags or inconsistencies in the information provided, and using other identity verification methods such as biometric authentication.
Can a Video Examination detect Heart Rate?
QuicSolv’s video conferencing solution – Remolin, has the ability to detect heart rate in real time using the proposer’s camera to capture images of the face and then analyzing the changes in the size of the blood vessels in the face as the heart beats.
The technique works by tracking the movement of the blood vessels in the face and measuring the changes in their size as the heart pumps blood through the body. This information is then used to calculate the heart rate. This can be a useful feature for insurance companies that are conducting Video Medical Exam Reviews (Video MERs) as part of the underwriting or sums assured process.
Can Heart Rate be used a tool to detect underlying Medical issues?
The idea of using heart rate as a tool during investigations is based on the understanding that anxiety and stress can affect a person’s heart rate, and monitoring changes in heart rate can potentially reveal important information about a person’s emotional state.
During an investigation, an investigator may use various techniques to induce stress or anxiety in a person in order to elicit a specific response. By monitoring the person’s heart rate in real time, the investigator can see how the person is responding physiologically to different lines of questioning or stimuli.
For example, if the person’s heart rate spikes significantly in response to a particular question or topic, the investigator may infer that the person is feeling anxious or stressed about that topic. This information can then be used to adjust the questioning strategy in real time, in order to either ease the person’s anxiety or to further explore the topic that is causing the emotional response.
It’s worth noting that heart rate alone cannot be relied upon as conclusive evidence of deception or guilt, as many factors can influence a person’s heart rate. However, when used in conjunction with other investigative techniques and tools, real-time heart rate monitoring can provide valuable insights into a person’s emotional state and help guide questioning strategy.
Geo-tagging and Geo-fencing
Geo tagging and geo fencing can be powerful tools for insurance companies operating in high-risk areas in India. Geo tagging involves adding location information to digital media, while geo fencing creates virtual boundaries around specific locations using GPS or RFID technology.
By using these tools during video calls, insurance companies can verify the location of the call and tailor insurance policies based on the location. For example, they can offer higher coverage for calls taking place in high-risk areas, and detect fraudulent activity to reduce the risk of fraudulent claims.
To enable geo tagging and geo fencing during video calls, GPS data is embedded in video calling apps. The accuracy of geo fencing varies depending on the technology and conditions under which it is used, with GPS typically being the most accurate. By carefully implementing geo tagging and geo fencing during video calls, insurance companies can better assess risk, verify claims, and improve customer experience without compromising individuals’ privacy or security.

Take Away
In addition to reducing costs and improving efficiency, Video MER can also help insurance companies to better serve their applicants by providing a more convenient and accessible way to report medical exams. It can also help to reduce the risk of exposure to infectious diseases by allowing insurance companies to conduct medical exams remotely, rather than requiring in-person visits.
