We had a significant and urgent request that came through this morning. Thank you and the team for responding to the banner removal. After the banner was removed, a contract for 15 new schools was signed! If it had not been removed our partner threatened to pull x2VOL from his offering. It was a tough situation so please thank the team for removing the banner from the home page. I know that this caused a delay in other items but I appreciate the response.

Warehouses have been typically places where we could store
“things”
. The advent of IoT brings to life all these so-called “things” and soon we would be renaming the Warehouse to
“AWarehouse”
……..a house which is aware of everything in it!!
Warehouses and current problems
Typically it is a large building where raw materials or manufactured goods may be stored prior to their distribution for sale. The very nature of it, we would find that things are getting dumped into places within the house. Time is lost in locating stuff if there is a lack of organization and indiscipline in the process followed in stores. It may happen that there is stuff in transit. Physical inventories are needed to ensure that the records are updated and the data in hand matches the actual quantities and locations. These problems are multiplied when you have multiple warehouse sites and that too spread across cities and countries. The list of issues would be a pile if you check with a warehouse manager.
How can IoT help?
IoT
ushers in – beehive-like connectivity with which it would be possible to have an aware network of all the relevant items or things. Simple tags, gateways, and beacons come together to make up a hub. Even humans would form a part of it by using wearables.
Now in such an environment, the moment raw materials get received they would be tagged and sent to the respective warehouses, if a worker takes it to the wrong one there could be an alarm on his wearable or if he locates the item incorrectly there could be an alarm and guided directions to walk to the correct one.
The inventory gets updated automatically when raw material is brought in. Similarly, when it is taken out, it could be checked if the worker taking it out is authorized to do it else there is an alarm to the warehouse manager. The inventory gets updated respectively. Similar and more stringent measures and security may be added for products. These are just very obvious use cases, there are many when one gets to the nitty-gritty.
Warehouse to Awarehouse
The transition from the current normal to a new normal is not a simple slide, it is a wavy and bumpy ride for sure. The first step is that they will need to accept this change. An Amazon store that can run almost unmanned and people can walk in and walk out with the items they need and get auto-billed – would have been the most difficult thing to accept though it was possible for Amazon themselves. Once what is possible becomes feasible in our minds, this transition will need to be handled at multiple levels since this would be impacting every cell of the company from the top to ground zero. Thus this change would have to be handled with care and patience, but surely it is a worthwhile destination.
Warehouse and beyond
Today’s IoT technology is on its way to not just making the environment more proactive but is going to making an impact on both how businesses are going to work and how businesses are going to function. Warehouses could be a starting point for this revolution.

The KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) form the basis of dashboards. Typically the top management in the company monitors the business using just the dashboard numbers, that too these get reviewed typically over a month or may be over a quarter depending on who is reviewing them.
Therefore it is very important, what you choose to measure as your KPI and how you measure
KPIs insight or oversight?
Does your KPIs give you the required insight into the working of your company or does it lead to oversight and incorrect or delayed decisions?
Measurement of performance is often subjected to both objective and subjective interpretations. Typically these are collected periodically and manually but many times these may not be authenticated values just authorized values. Thus the data we have is realized data neither guaranteed real nor real-time!!
Thus, KPIs derived from these data points obviously suffer from the lacunae that are neither leading indicators nor 100% authentic. Therefore decisions tend to get taken either incorrectly or knowing the unreliability of data, many times decisions are taken using subjective feedback instead of an objective data-oriented approach making them tacit.
IoT a shot in the arm
There are very few systems out there that do consecutive management of continuous data feeds and ensures business activities are considered from all angles. Now using the
Internet of Things (IoT)
this becomes feasible, it is not only the data streaming of the relevant data – we could now look at even the contextual data around the data points being monitored posted by the related IoT devices.
The fact that there was low productivity in the last month is not the only data one would have at hand, it would also be available that the capacity was lowered with two machines having breakdowns in this period.
Data going further will no longer be isolated, it would huge, it would numerous and it would be connected. This kind of IoT data, mesh feeding into the KPIs, perhaps there may be a new set of KPIs that may get measured in the new context. Therefore, the KPIs and dashboards will become more proactive with all the bells and whistles that never were possible.
Live and Ground Zero
Armed with such IoT cloud systems which combine all the IoT data points and bring them together in a multi-dimensional way to build the complete virtual context around the activities, tomorrow’s KPIs and management decisions are surely going to be more strong footed, data-oriented, and proactive than ever before!!

Increasing Productivity has been a lifelong pursuit for many individuals and an eternal call for action for businesses on the whole. There have been so many best sellers and content that has got generated and read for the sake of it. IoT definitely brings in its own share of how productivity can be increased!!
IoT and Productivity
IoT is going to have an impact on every aspect of our lives and how can productivity not be impacted by it. Increasing productivity though a cliche word will have it’s own ways and means when it comes to
IoT
and obviously a big change will be needed to make it effective.
Let us explore it further
IoT and Better Manufacturing
Companies are now enabled to monitor like never before. By obtaining and analyzing data at different points in the complex product processes, they are looking to understand better where the process takes a lag and thereby becomes less productive. The production lines can be kept on the roll more efficiently by ensuring that the line is monitored and fed optimally to keep the flow or throughput at its best. It can be ensured that the raw materials needed are made available and planning can be far more feasible since the variables in the process are going to get reduced.
The floor managers now would be able to keep track on the different assets. Thus there will be less time lost in looking for things are they are all trackable. There is more security of the important assets and systems that can ensure that things are not left out in the wrong places. Ability to guide workers to the right destinations and ability to provide warnings to the users in case there is any hazardous situations.
Aspects like better Inventory management, better and optimal procurement, lesser cost of carry would fall in place. Increased reduction of operational costs slowly and steadily would give additional leverage.
With increased efficiency and transparency in the manufacturing processes, the predictability would stand to increase and the ability to provide a better ETA to customers now becomes more of the statistical affair than that of a heroic effort by the team thereby reducing the wear and tear of the men as well as the machines. This obviously would also mean increased capacity and hence more output when needed.
IoT and Better Sales
Increased ability to manage and track inventories especially of products would extend to making order fulfillment much more a smoother process. The overall process of sales would become faster and transparent. With lesser lead times the satisfaction level of the customer would increase.
It could also lead to better distribution, engagement with the distributors and moving forward and better and deeper connect even to the retailer level by making the use of IoT.
IoT and Better Post Sales
IoT is not just going to be restricted to the making of the product, it is going to proliferate the product too. Soon we would be having smart products which can diagnose the problems and tell the customer what needs to be done if it is an easy fix. Possibly we may even have these products directly registering support calls the moment there is a breakdown so you have a support person connecting as soon as there is the breakdown. It promises to go to the extent of letting the support know that there is a need for part replacement to prevent a breakdown. The downside is that Post Sales Support would no longer give a sense of victory after dealing with the customer support that one is gets now!!
IoT All the way
IoT thus would be impacting all the aspects of a product and leaving no room for doubt that it is going to usher in Wave of Productivity.

“In life there are no guarantees, only opportunities”
– General Patton
This is so true and in the context of an organization, and the opportunity here is the option to act. This call for action needs decision(s) and there are always two options available one is to act and the other is to choose to not act!! Many times the second option seems the simplest and easily opt-out.
This does not happen here!!!
Many would tend to disagree that there is indecision in their organizations. Many times it is not that there are no decisions taken but that the decisions taken invariably turn out to be as good as no action taken.
Let us look at one of our customer scenarios that clarify it. The customer wants to be in a position to make a decision if the machine needs to be stopped temporarily or is it gearing up for an impending servicing. Traditionally both these decisions would be left to the person in charge to decide if the machinery continues to work despite reaching the cutoff temperature and if the maintenance should be scheduled for this machine yet.
In both cases, the decision to stop the machinery or schedule maintenance may get procrastinated in the want or intent of keeping the production going – which may not be a right decision or informed decision and hence would be as good as no decision taken!!!
The question is could this decision have been taken in a timely and effective manner?
Hyper Decision Making
This term was coined by
Ted Marra
and refers to the ability of an organization to make faster and better decisions, especially at the strategic level. One of the components in this ecosystem is what is called “sensing systems” which essentially in today’s context would be a decision intelligence system instead of a decision support system, which is aware of the operating environment. Hyper Decision Making is kind of a maturity model for the decision making capability of an organization.
The scope of the model is much wider and the essence that is subscribed to here is the outcome –
making the organization more agile by changing the decision making process to a faster and effective activity
.
How will IoT help in Hyper Decision Making?
Internet of Things (IoT) brings into the picture, a lot of visibility with the data getting churned along with the processes that are executing. The raw data will not help and will need to go through a certain amount of connecting, massaging, slicing, dicing, etc to make it into groups of relevant data which starts making sense together and is no longer in isolation but a logical group possibly a time snapshot of the subsystems and processes involved.
There may be more Data analytics that gets applied on this data map or graph for multidimensional analysis to provide a possible trend and eventuality. Thus we would now be able to conclude and forecast if the process arteries are starting to clog rather than wait to detect high blood pressure and conclude the possible clogging.
Some possibilities like, If there is regular costly maintenance that is in place for a critical piece of machinery, one can easily take a decision in terms of optimally scheduling maintenance based on the data as to if there is a need for one now and not do it because of standard operating procedure. One would be able to optimize and do things in a more timely manner because now we would have sufficient data and information for taking the call or decision to do things or not.
Consider the customer scenario cited, the solution that we are working upon is that of enabling the customer to use
IoT
data and using an IoT device viz. a smart temperature sensor to record the temperatures sensed and if the temperature sustains beyond a threshold range, sends a signal to cut off the engine and send a message to the relevant stakeholders of this decision taken. Likewise, a vibration sensor to detect the vibrations of the machinery to take a decision as to whether the maintenance needs to be scheduled for the machinery and notifying the maintenance in charge and the production-in-charge of the decision. These are hyper decisions taken – no longer subjective. These decisions can be even more augmented by adding more intelligence.
Information is power and more information is going to be even more power!!
With the advent of IoT cloud-based systems, even governance models, as well as the decision making triggers, are going to change. The need for decision making is going to also become more judicial. Simple decisions that could be taken based on the data available are no longer going to wait for human intervention. The trigger for human intervention will now become more strategic and possibly tactical than at the hardcore operational level. Machine-to-machine communication and simple reasoning would come to play to change the work environment slowly, surely and completely.
IoT technology will bring in a lot of visibility into what is happening and will give us that inside data we have been missing to make decisions with more confidence and speed for sure and enabling Hyper Decisions…!!

Aadhar Card Masking: Protecting Privacy in Accordance with Government Regulations
Aadhaar, the unique identification number issued by the Government of India, is an essential identity document for Indian citizens. However, with the increasing use of Aadhaar in various sectors, concerns about data privacy and security have become more pronounced. In response, the government has implemented regulations to ensure that Aadhaar data is protected and safeguarded.
For companies in the BFSI sector, Aadhaar is a critical component of their operations. However, they must also ensure that they comply with the regulations related to Aadhaar masking. Aadhaar masking is the process of hiding the first eight digits of Aadhaar numbers while revealing only the last four digits. This helps protect the privacy and security of individuals’ Aadhaar data, while still allowing companies to use the information for legitimate purposes.
Read ahead and get a comprehensive guide on Aadhaar masking and its regulations. We will also highlight the benefits of Aadhaar masking for companies in the BFSI sector and provide you with best practices for implementing it.

What is Aadhaar Masking?
Aadhaar masking is a process of partially hiding the first eight digits of an Aadhaar number while revealing only the last four digits. This is done to protect the privacy and security of individuals’ Aadhaar data, while still allowing companies to use the information for legitimate purposes.
Explanation of the Process:
The process of Aadhaar masking involves :
Masking First Eight Digits:
Modifying the Aadhaar number to hide the first eight digits, and only display the last four digits. This can be done manually or using automated software tools.
Masking of Eyes:
Aadhaar card also contains a photograph of the individual, which includes their eyes. Masking of eyes is necessary to protect the privacy and security of the individual, as it prevents unauthorized use of the individual’s biometric information. Biometric information such as iris and fingerprint scans can be used to identify an individual and grant access to their personal information, making it important to protect this information by masking the eyes.
Masking of QR Code:
The QR code on the Aadhaar card contains sensitive information such as the individual’s Aadhaar number, demographic details, and biometric information. Masking the QR code ensures that this information is not easily accessible to unauthorized parties. Additionally, masking the QR code helps to prevent the misuse of the Aadhaar data, as it prevents individuals from using the QR code to access or share sensitive information without the individual’s consent.
Greater convenience:
Video MER can be more convenient for policyholders or applicants who are located in remote or underserved areas, or who have mobility or transportation issues.
Reduced risk of exposure to infectious diseases:
By reviewing medical exams remotely, underwriters can reduce the risk of exposure to infectious diseases, which can be especially important during times of pandemic or other public health emergencies.
Regulations related to Aadhaar Masking
The government of India has implemented regulations related to Aadhaar masking to ensure the privacy and security of individuals’ Aadhaar data. Companies in the BFSI sector are required to comply with these regulations while using Aadhaar data for legitimate purposes.
Overview of the Regulations:
As per the guidelines provided by UIDA and the latest guidelines given on the link (
https://www.uidai.gov.in/images/Aadhaar_In_Media_22_March_2023.pdf
), companies must follow the following regulations related to Aadhaar masking:
Masking of Aadhaar numbers:
Companies must mask the first eight digits of Aadhaar numbers while revealing only the last four digits. This applies to both physical and digital Aadhaar cards.
Masking of eyes and QR code:
In addition to masking the Aadhaar number, companies must also mask the individual’s eyes and QR code on the Aadhaar card.
Consent for Aadhaar authentication:
Companies must obtain explicit consent from the individual for Aadhaar authentication. The consent must be obtained separately for each use case and cannot be obtained through coercion or misrepresentation.
Storage and protection of Aadhaar data:
Companies must store Aadhaar data securely and protect it from unauthorized access or misuse. They must also ensure that the data is not shared with unauthorized parties.
Consequences of Non-Compliance:
Non-compliance with the regulations related to Aadhaar masking can result in penalties and legal action against the company. Companies may be fined, and their license to use Aadhaar data may be revoked. Additionally, non-compliance can damage the company’s reputation and erode the trust of its customers. It is, therefore, essential for companies to comply with the regulations to protect themselves and their customers from harm.
Benefits of Aadhaar Masking for Companies:
Aadhaar masking offers several benefits to companies in the BFSI sector. It helps them to protect the privacy and security of their customers’ Aadhaar data while still using it for legitimate purposes. Here are some of the benefits of Aadhaar masking for companies:
Overview of the Benefits:
Enhanced Privacy and Security:
Aadhaar masking helps companies to protect the privacy and security of their customers’ Aadhaar data by masking sensitive information such as the first eight digits of Aadhaar numbers, eyes, and QR codes.
Improved Compliance:
Companies can comply with the regulations related to Aadhaar masking by implementing appropriate masking techniques. Compliance helps to prevent penalties and legal action against the company.
Enhanced Customer Trust:

Enhance Risk Control with Videography: A Powerful Addition to VideoMER
Enhance Risk Control with Videography: A Powerful Addition to VideoMER
Welcome to the world of Videography, a transformative approach to health assessments in the insurance industry. Videography combines the precision of in-person medical examinations with the convenience and efficiency of digital technology. This innovative process not only streamlines the assessment of an insurance proposer’s health status but also establishes a new standard for accuracy and reliability in risk evaluation.
At the core of Videography is the integration of live video calls, where medical professionals conduct real-time health screenings. This process ensures that the insured or proposer is in the right state of health and mind for the assessment, paving the way for transparent and direct communication. The interaction is not just a conversation; it is a comprehensive medical examination, observed and recorded to uphold the integrity of the process.
Videography brings the Diagnostic Center to a proposer’s home, saving the hassle of travel and wait times. A certified phlebotomist arrives at the proposer’s doorstep, equipped with state-of-the-art medical tools and a commitment to compassionate care. As they guide the proposer through the procedure, every step is meticulously recorded via a secure video link. This not only assures you of a personal touch in every interaction but also allows for an unobtrusive yet thorough health examination.
From verifying identity with government-approved ID cards to conducting an ECG, from collecting a urine sample to drawing blood, every procedure is performed with the utmost professionalism and attention to detail. The result is a seamless fusion of human expertise and digital efficiency — an authentic proof the insurance company needs that the process was performed to the best.
Videography provides a panoramic view, ensuring that an insurance company has a complete and accurate understanding of a proposers medical profile. It’s not just about assessing risk; it’s about embracing innovation to provide the insurance underwriters with the best possible insurance solutions.
The Superiority of Videography Over VideoMER
The process of assessing a proposer’s health status for insurance is critical, with no room for inaccuracies or manipulation. This is where Videography’s comprehensive approach truly outperforms VideoMER. Here’s an in-depth look at the benefits of Videography:
Guaranteed Procedure Verification:
With VideoMER lacking visual confirmation, there’s uncertainty about the authenticity of the health data collected. Videography eradicates these doubts. It ensures that every step, from blood draws to urine collection, is visually recorded and monitored, eliminating the question of whether procedures were properly conducted.
Elimination of Fraud Risk:
In a VideoMER setup, there’s potential for proposers to unduly influence the phlebotomist, leading to falsified health records. Videography closes this loophole by providing live video oversight, making it virtually impossible for proposers to sway the recording of vital signs or manipulate the collection of samples. This live recording acts as a safeguard, maintaining the integrity of the data.
Transparent and Accurate Blood Draws:
One of the biggest challenges with VideoMER is ensuring that the blood sample is genuinely drawn from the proposer. Videography’s live-streamed process means there can be no substitution or deception. The phlebotomist’s actions are in full view, ensuring the blood sample’s authenticity.
Verifiable Blood Pressure Readings:
Blood pressure can fluctuate with even slight manipulations. Videography’s real-time recording prevents the proposer from influencing the phlebotomist to report incorrect readings. Each reading is taken and recorded under the watchful eye of the medical professional, assuring underwriters of its accuracy.
Data Integrity for Underwriters:
The crux of insurance underwriting is reliable data. Videography’s recorded sessions provide underwriters with an unimpeachable record of the health screening process. This level of transparency and detail offers underwriters a clear view of the proposer’s health, enabling them to make well-informed decisions. With VideoMER, the lack of visual confirmation can lead to underwriting policies based on erroneous data, a risk that Videography eliminates entirely.
The Videography Process: A Step-by-Step Overview
Videography is revolutionizing the insurance medical examination process with its meticulous and transparent approach. Here’s a detailed walk-through of the Videography process that demonstrates its thoroughness and reliability:
Step 1. Scheduling and Preparation:
The journey begins when a proposer schedules an appointment. A certified phlebotomist is then dispatched to the proposer’s location, equipped with all necessary medical instruments and a secure video recording device.
Step 2. Initial Verification:
Upon arrival, the phlebotomist confirms the identity of the proposer using government-approved ID cards, such as Aadhar or PAN, ensuring that the health data collected corresponds to the correct individual.
Step 3. Setting the Stage:
The phlebotomist prepares the equipment and ensures that the proposer is comfortable and ready for the examination. The proposer’s consent is obtained before the video recording begins, establishing a foundation of trust and transparency.
Step 4. Live Video Link:
A video link is established with a medical professional who oversees the entire process. If the proposer lacks the necessary technology, the phlebotomist assists by providing access to a device, ensuring no one is excluded from the service.
Step 5. Real-Time Observation:
As the phlebotomist conducts the medical tests, including ECG, urine sample collection, measures height, weight, blood pressure and blood draws, the medical professional watches and records each step. This live supervision prevents any discrepancies and affirms the authenticity of the test procedures and results.
Step 6. Documenting the Details:
Throughout the examination, the proposer’s vital statistics, such as weight, height, and blood pressure, are measured and verbally confirmed by the phlebotomist, with the medical professional recording these details for a clear audio-visual log.
Step 7. Identity and Document Verification:
The proposer presents their ID to the camera, allowing the system to capture and verify it against government records automatically. This step eliminates the risk of identity fraud and ensures that the medical data collected is accurately attributed.
Step 8. Completion and Reporting:
A complete VideoMER is then done by a medical professional. Once the medical assessment is complete, the doctor compiles a comprehensive health report. This report is then made available to the underwriter, providing a detailed and verified account of the proposer’s health status.
Step 9. Quality Assurance and Follow-up:
After the session, the recorded video and collected health data undergo a rigorous quality assurance check to ensure all procedures were carried out correctly and all information is accurate. Follow-up actions are taken as necessary, based on the findings of the assessment.
Videography in Action: A Real-Time Demonstration
To truly appreciate the impact and functionality of Videography, seeing it in action is invaluable. We invite you to watch our detailed demonstration video on YouTube. This visual guide provides an in-depth look at how Videography seamlessly integrates technology with medical expertise to revolutionize health assessments in the insurance sector.
Experience the Efficiency and Precision of Videography
In this video, you’ll witness the meticulous process of a Videography session, from the initial identity verification to the comprehensive medical examination conducted by our skilled phlebotomists and overseen by medical professionals via video link. Pay close attention to the real-time recording and reporting, which form the cornerstone of this innovative approach.
Not only does this demonstration highlight the procedural aspects, but it also sheds light on the human element of Videography. You’ll see the care and professionalism that goes into making each session as comfortable and informative as possible for the proposer.
By the end of the video, you’ll have a deeper understanding of why Videography is the preferred choice for accurate and transparent health screenings in the insurance industry.
In conclusion, Videography represents a significant leap forward in the realm of insurance health assessments. By marrying the precision of medical science with the advancements of digital technology, it offers an unrivaled level of accuracy, security, and convenience. This innovative approach not only enhances the integrity of the underwriting process but also provides a seamless and reassuring experience for the proposer. As we continue to embrace and refine this technology, Videography stands as a beacon of progress in the insurance industry, setting new standards for reliability and trust in health screenings. Join us in this journey towards a more transparent and efficient future in insurance health assessments, where every individual’s health story is captured accurately and respectfully.

Innovative Medical Underwriting Solutions for the Digital Age
At QuicSolv, we bring a fresh perspective to medical underwriting in life insurance, focusing on enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of health risk assessments. Our approach pivots on two key stages: medical examinations and review. Utilizing our innovative Video MER technology, we capture detailed medical histories interactively, while our advanced videography offerings ensure precise paramedical evaluations. The digitization of pathology reports from diagnostic centers completes our comprehensive data analysis, enabling us to present a holistic health profile to underwriters. This technological synergy not only streamlines the underwriting process but also elevates its precision, making QuicSolv a vanguard in the intersection of healthcare and technology in insurance underwriting.
The QuicSolv’s Medical Underwriting Assistance Process
Step 1: Video Medical Examination Reports (Video MER) with Advanced AI Quality Check
Initial Contact:
The process begins with a
Video MER
session, where applicants interact via video conference with medical professionals.
Comprehensive Data Collection:
During this session, detailed medical histories, current health status, past ailments, family health history, and lifestyle habits are discussed and recorded.
Interactive Assessment:
This interactive format ensures thorough information gathering, allowing for immediate clarifications and follow-ups.
AI-Based Quality Check:
Post-session, an AI-driven quality check is performed on the recorded video call. This advanced review process ensures that no errors – such as missed disclosures or incorrect documentation – are present, guaranteeing the integrity and accuracy of the medical examination.
Step 2: Paramedical Examination and Videography
On-site Health Checks:
A certified phlebotomist conducts on-site health checks, which are recorded using our
specialized videography services
. This includes measuring vital signs like BMI, blood pressure, waist circumference and pulse.
Secure Video Capture:
The entire examination is securely captured on video. This transparency ensures accuracy in health evaluation and builds trust in the medical underwriting process.
Step 3: Digitization and Integration of Medical Examination Data
A medical underwriter spends a lot of time analyzing pages and pages of a
pathology lab report
in the traditional setting. Digitization of these pathology reports helps reduce the turn around time in medical underwriting.
Collection of Diagnostic Data:
After the medical examination, any required blood investigation report or other diagnostic procedures are conducted. The results from these tests form a critical part of the medical underwriting data.
Digital Integration:
The results are digitized and integrated into our system. This includes converting paper-based pathology lab reports into digital formats for easy analysis and access.
Smart Reports
:
Smart Reports revolutionize medical underwriting by presenting health data in an intuitive, visual format. This advancement not only simplifies the underwriter’s task of interpreting complex medical information but also ensures accuracy in risk assessment and policy decision-making. By offering a clear, comprehensive view of an individual’s health profile,
Smart Reports
enable underwriters to make informed decisions quickly, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the medical underwriting process in the insurance sector.
Step 4: Data Analysis and Review
Holistic Health Profile Construction:

TeleMER: Pioneering Digital Health Assessments in Insurance
Welcome to the foundational world of TeleMER, an innovative approach that marked the beginning of digital health assessments in the insurance industry. The term ‘MER’ stands for Medical Examination Report, a crucial part of the insurance underwriting process. TeleMER, or telephonic MER, revolutionized how these medical examinations were conducted by introducing a telephonic format, paving the way for advancements like VideoMER and Videography.
The Genesis of TeleMER:
TeleMER emerged as a solution to streamline the traditional MER process, which often involved in-person medical tests and face-to-face interviews. By shifting these interactions to a telephonic medium, TeleMER made the initial health assessment more accessible and efficient.
Understanding the MER Test:
In the context of insurance, the MER test is a comprehensive health evaluation that underwriters rely on to determine the risk profile of a proposer. It typically includes gathering medical history, current health status, and lifestyle information. TeleMER enabled these details to be collected over a phone call, bringing convenience to both the insurance company and the proposer.
TeleMER’s Role in the Insurance Process:
During a TeleMER session, trained professionals conduct a detailed interview with the proposer, asking a series of predetermined questions. These queries are designed to cover a wide range of health-related topics, ensuring that the insurer gets a clear picture of the proposer’s medical condition and risks.
The Transition to Video-based Assessments:
While TeleMER offered significant improvements over traditional methods, it had its limitations, primarily the lack of visual verification. This led to the evolution of
VideoMER
– a method that retains the thorough questioning of TeleMER but adds the crucial element of visual confirmation through video calls.
The TeleMER Process: Streamlining Health Assessments Over the Phone
1. Scheduling the Call:
The TeleMER process begins with scheduling a phone call between the insurance proposer and a trained medical professional.
This flexibility allows the proposer to choose a convenient time, thus ensuring their full attention and cooperation during the assessment.
2. Preparing for the Call:
Proposers are advised to have relevant medical information handy, such as their medical history, current medications, and any recent test results.
This preparation ensures that the call is efficient and that all necessary information is readily available.
3. Conducting the Interview:
The core of the TeleMER process is the telephonic interview. During this call, the medical professional asks a series of structured questions.
These questions cover various aspects of the proposer’s health, including medical history, lifestyle choices, and any existing conditions.
4. Gathering Detailed Information:
The interviewer carefully records the proposer’s responses, gathering comprehensive data about their health status.
This information is crucial for underwriters to accurately assess the risk associated with the insurance policy.
5. Addressing Queries and Concerns:
TeleMER also provides an opportunity for proposers to ask questions and clarify any doubts they might have about the insurance process or the health information being requested.
This two-way communication ensures transparency and builds trust between the proposer and the insurance company.
6. Documentation and Reporting:
Post-call, the information collected is meticulously documented and sent to the insurance company’s underwriting team.
This report forms the basis for evaluating the insurance application and determining policy terms.
7. Quality Assurance:
Quality checks are conducted to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information gathered during the TeleMER call.
Any discrepancies or additional requirements are addressed in follow-up communications.
Advantages and Limitations of TeleMER
TeleMER, as an early foray into digitalizing the insurance health assessment process, brought several advantages to the table while also facing certain limitations. Understanding these helps in appreciating the evolution towards more advanced methods like VideoMER and Videography.
Advantages of TeleMER:
1. Enhanced Accessibility and Convenience:
TeleMER made the medical examination process more accessible, allowing proposers to participate in the assessment from the comfort of their homes.
This convenience significantly reduced the time and effort required for both proposers and insurers, streamlining the overall process.
2. Time-Efficiency:
By eliminating the need for physical appointments, TeleMER saved considerable time for both the insurance applicants and the medical professionals.
The telephonic format allowed for quick and efficient collection of health-related information.
3. Reduced Costs:
TeleMER helped in cutting down the costs associated with in-person medical examinations, such as travel expenses and the use of medical facilities.
4. Initial Risk Assessment:
The process provided insurers with an initial understanding of the proposer’s health, aiding in the early stages of risk assessment and underwriting.
Limitations of TeleMER:
1. Lack of Visual Verification:
Unlike VideoMER or Videography, TeleMER lacked the capability to visually verify the information provided by the proposer, such as physical health indicators or identity validation.
2. Limited Scope of Health Assessment:
The telephonic interview format restricted the depth of health assessment, as it relied solely on verbal communication and self-reported information.
Certain health parameters, such as blood pressure or weight, could not be accurately measured or verified.
3. Potential for Inaccurate Reporting:
The reliance on proposers’ self-reported information raised concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the data collected.
There was a risk of misunderstanding or miscommunication during the call, leading to incomplete or erroneous health records.
4. No Real-Time Medical Testing:
TeleMER did not include any real-time medical testing, which limited its effectiveness in capturing comprehensive health data.
5. Risk of Impersonation:
A significant concern with TeleMER was the high possibility of impersonation. Without visual verification, there was no foolproof way to ensure that the person on the call was indeed the proposer, raising concerns about the integrity of the data collected.
Transition to VideoMER and Videography: Advancing Beyond TeleMER
The evolution from TeleMER to VideoMER and Videography marks a significant leap in the insurance industry’s approach to health assessments. This transition was driven by the need to overcome the limitations inherent in TeleMER and to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the MER (Medical Examination Report) process.
1. Overcoming TeleMER Limitations:
Recognizing the constraints of TeleMER, such as the lack of visual verification and the high risk of impersonation, the insurance industry sought more robust solutions. The need to ensure that the MER test means more than just a telephonic interview became apparent.
2. Introduction of VideoMER:
VideoMER emerged as a sophisticated evolution of TeleMER. It retained the comprehensive questioning inherent in the MER medical test but introduced visual elements crucial for verification. This method offered a more reliable way to conduct the MER test for insurance, as it allowed underwriters to see and interact with the proposer in real-time.
3. What is MER Test in the Context of VideoMER:
In VideoMER, the MER test involves not just a series of questions but also visual confirmation of the proposer’s identity and health status. This visual aspect significantly reduced the risk of impersonation and provided a more accurate representation of the proposer’s health.
4. Videography: A Comprehensive Approach:
Videography further expanded on the foundations laid by VideoMER. While VideoMER addressed the visual limitations of TeleMER, Videography introduced real-time medical examinations into the process. This included live recordings of medical procedures like blood draws and vital signs measurements, ensuring an even more detailed and accurate MER medical test.
5. The Significance of the Transition:
The transition from TeleMER to VideoMER and subsequently to Videography represents a paradigm shift in how MER tests are conducted for insurance purposes. These advancements not only increase the precision of health assessments but also enhance the overall trust and efficiency of the insurance underwriting process.
The journey from TeleMER to
VideoMER
and
Videography
illustrates the insurance industry’s commitment to adopting new technologies and methods. These advancements have transformed the way MER tests are conducted, offering a more holistic and reliable assessment of a proposer’s health and significantly reducing the potential for fraud. As we continue to innovate, the question ‘what is an MER test?’ evolves, reflecting the ongoing refinement of insurance health assessments.

Apart from these asset monitoring, energy savings, equipment maintenance are some of the areas that Healthcare centers are planning on the use of IoT.
5) Smart Farming
Farming is also a field that is not to be left behind. It is needed that the agricultural yields have to double by 2050. This kind of increase needs much more than the current practices of farming. There are ideas like precision farming where a piece of looked as a collection of multiple farms based on the type and properties of the soil. The possibility of real time and continuous monitoring is something that has not been applied to it by far. With data collected from the soil, wind and environmental conditions and cheaper iot devices and more connectivity spreading affordable solutions that can be deployed would become feasible.
What will tip them off?
There is already a lot of traction in all these areas, what is holding the reins is due to multiple reasons – mature solutions, cost, ROI fears and scale of impact.
Once we have more mature and end to solutions that get deployed and more IoT devices getting manufactured the over cost (TCO) would be much lower and more people are going to receptive to adopting it. This would help allay the ROI fears. The scale of all these application areas is huge and would naturally would go slow initially but with time the momentum is expected to catch up and make up for the time.

How IoT works with Real Life IoT Examples
How IoT works with Real Life IoT Examples
“My wife climbed up upon the weighing machine and the fridge announced that ‘You no longer have access to me’…”
This is how IoT (
Internet of things
) will work in the future. Though this was a joke, most devices in the future will be connected with each other and a hyper decision framework will define the further course of action.
Before you understand how IoT works, it is important to understand what are the important pieces and how do they piece together the puzzle, let us, therefore, look at what are the different components involved here.
COMPONENTS OF IOT
The main components which make the IoT magic work are :
1) IoT Sensors
2) Connectivity/Network
3) Cloud
4) Hyper Decision Framework
5) User Interface
1] IoT Sensors
The “things” on the internet of things (IoT) come to life because of sensors. Let’s take an IoT service example, where the heating of a machine is being monitored. In a typical scenario, a heat sensor would display the temperature on an analog or digital screen and someone would be monitoring it physically or on a more advanced level when the heating goes beyond a threshold there would be an alarm raised. You will need to be in proximity to the alarm to take action.
In an IoT setup, however, this sensor would be able to send a message to a decision engine that has rules built in to take the action.
There are many types of internet of things sensors viz. temperature sensor, humidity sensor, pressure sensor, CO2 sensor, light sensor, occupancy sensor, motion sensor, and the list can go on and on. What is important is that these sensors are an important part of the ‘IoT device components’ and are the origin of truth and when connected with a decision engine, they can make things work.
2] Connectivity / Network
Now that we understand the sensor technology in IoT and what they do, let’s get to know, how they communicate with the decision engine.
Decision engines are not new. They have been in existence for a few decades in the form of PLCs. But most of these connections to the decision engines have been wired. With the increase in sensors and the proliferation of these in various devices and machines, it became more and more important to connect wirelessly.
Various connectivity protocols using radio frequency technology, have emerged in recent years. Some of the most widely used technologies are,
Bluetooth Low Energy BLE
, LoRa (Long Range Technology), ZigBee,
SigFox
and NBIoT (Narrow Band IoT). There is no need to get flabbergasted by these terms. In simple terms, all these technologies have modulated the radio frequencies to provide wireless connectivity for data originating from IoT sensors.
While all the above technologies have used case-based
applications in IoT
, the one that has gained the most popularity is BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). Most IoT sensors can send their data to BLE using UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) and Modbus communication protocols, BLE devices have the ability to transmit this information wirelessly, to other BLE devices and or BLE receivers called Gateways.
While adding many receivers may not be possible either because of the cost or due to infrastructure limitations, BLE devices can be arranged in a Mesh Network, so that the intended receiver can receive the message through nodes that are connected on the Mesh Network. Solutions like these have made the proliferation of IoT sensors and devices across industries like
Health Care
, Retail, Logistics, and Manufacturing
Once the receivers have received the data, they can send this information to the decision engines, which are mostly sitting in the cloud Private or Public cloud using onboard GPRS, WiFi or LTE.
3] IoT Cloud
Now that we have been able to send the data to the cloud, let’s try and understand what is the IoT Cloud and how it is an integral part of understanding how IoT works.
IoT sensors are usually resource-constrained and need a destination where they can send the data. An
MQTT (MQ Telemetry Transport) protocol
is generally used by these IoT sensors to transmit data. MQTT works like a broker that receives and transmits information to whoever subscribes to it on a topic. This MQTT server is generally also called the IoT server. Generally, rules are defined on this server so that data can be filtered as it comes in.
Do some have confusion on why should one need an IoT server? At the rate at which the IoT sensors send data, a regular server would not be able to handle the requests.
At QuicSolv Technologies, along with the MQTT, we have built a ‘Hyper Decision Framework’ called ISAE. Data from the IoT cloud server is sent to this framework. Let’s now understand
what is ISAE
and why is it required.
4] Hyper Decision Framework – ISAE
IoT sensors have the ability to send data to the cloud. What we do with that data is very important. In one of our employee monitoring solutions, if an employee accidentally enters a hazard area, the hyper-decision framework immediately sends an alarm and notification to the people involved. So, let’s break this down to understand how IoT worked. The employee tag worn by the employee sent a message to the receiver that ‘I (40567) am here. The receiver sent this message to the MQTT server. The Hyper Decision Framework picked this up and checked if employee ID 40567 was authorized to be in the area. If not, it sent out the alarms.
So, a hyper decision framework is a set of rules built inside a rule engine that works at hyper speeds. The analysis of information received and mapping this information against a set of rules that may overlap with each other and executing the decision associated with the rule is what we call the hyper-decision framework.
As another example, you may experience that in some movie theaters when the theater is not full, the temperature inside could be lower than what is comfortable, and when the theater is full, you would like the temperature to be a bit lower to make it comfortable. This is because the HVAC is sending the same amount of airflow irrespective of the number of people inside the theater. By using our Occupancy IoT Sensor, we could send the number of people in the theater to the Hyper Decision Engine and it could automatically regulate the airflow, thereby, not only reducing the cost but also making our movie-watching experience better.
5] User Interface
Lastly, there needs to be an interface to this entire system. This may manifest typically as a
mobile application
and it can also be used as a web-based application. This will help to provide the Machine to People interface to the solution.
This interface will help the user to interact with the system, like in the case of home automation the user interface provided will help the user to switch on or off the lights or fan in a specific room. In an industrial application, the shop floor manager can directly control a machine based on the data inputs.
Real-Life IoT Examples – How IoT Works
Now that we have understood the concepts, let’s understand a few ‘Examples of How IoT Works
Shopping Mall – Proximity Marketing
The shopper of today likes to feel and touch a product before making a purchase but also prefers the convenience of a digital lens. Today, IoT is making proximity marketing a reality such that when a shopper who frequents a particular store is in close proximity to that store, IoT sensors can send the information of the user to the hyper decision framework, which will analyze the shopper’s behavior and shopping pattern to send the right message, at the right location, at the right time and to the right person.
Asset Tracking
Assets for Industry could be high-value inventory, tools, fixtures, dies, gigs, etc. for the Health Care sector, it could be various movable test machines like the ECG Machine, Ultrasound machine, portable X-Ray machine, stretchers, wheelchairs, etc. These assets need to be tracked so that it is easy to monitor the life of the asset, the location of the asset and assist with the yearly audit of the assets.
Assets are attached with BLE IoT Sensors. These sensors talk to the receivers and anyone who needs the information on the asset can check the dashboard/application/mobile device to check where the asset is.
Warehouse Pallet Tracking
Reusable pallets in a warehouse are an important asset for many organizations. With warehouses, becoming larger in size and the range of inventory increasing every year, pallet tracking helps with easy identification of the location of the pallets and reduce wastages of time and precious inventory.
BLE IoT Sensors can also be placed on pallets, which can provide valuable information on the location of the pallet, information on the inventory the pallet is holding, and from what time.
Employee Monitoring
Monitoring of the employee within the campus of the organization is not only important from the point of view of increasing productivity, but also for security and boosting morale.
BLE IoT sensors in the form of ID Cards can be worn by the employee. These ID cards have IoT sensors for sensing whether or not the card is on a person so that security can be managed and proximity to each machine or process will track the productivity.
Temperature and Humidity Monitoring
The supply chain management for ‘Cold Chain’ has the maximum use of IoT sensors. These sensors record the temperature and humidity inside the containers and send that data along with the GPS location of the truck. The advantage in comparison to current data loggers is that instead of pointing a finger and blame game, the IoT sensor can talk to the Hyper Decision Framework and help correct the problem in real-time. Thereby saving money, time, and reputation.
Security Patrol Guard Management
The biggest challenge that security guards have is that when terror strikes, they don’t have the tools to communicate with their teams to seek help. Most of the time the security patrol guard has to either lose his weapon or lose his life.
How does IoT help here? The security guard, wears the BLE ID Card, on his shoulder. In case of an attack, he can press the distress button on the card twice. This SoS signal can be sent to the IoT cloud server in real-time and the hyper-decision framework kicks in to send the message to the nearest help available.
Internet of Things Water Sensor
There are large reservoirs or tanks where the water level needs to be monitored to help take appropriate actions. Most level sensors require power and at times, it may not be possible to provide power at the location. This is where IoT sensors can be placed at various levels in the tank. As soon as water touches each sensor, the level indication can be communicated and appropriate action can be taken.
Safe Return To Work
In the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, the biggest challenge faced by businesses is maintaining
social distancing in the workplace
, monitoring health and hygiene, and employee tracking. With the help of our IoT-based Smart ID cards – Genio, you can track employees’ health data, temperature, and hand-washing time, and ensure they’re following the social distancing guidelines. As a bonus, the real-time monitoring of the workforce will also increase productivity by seeing that employees are in their designated areas at all times.
The kind of use cases mentioned here is only a fraction of use cases that demonstrate the power of IoT. Not just in business, today smart homes are also becoming IoT-enabled. This soon is poised to extend into smart cities. Thus applications of IoT can result in many more smart devices and connected devices changing the very way of doing things as we know them today!!
Yard Management System
Any business with a large supply chain is impacted by delays at the yard. Quicsolv offers a Yard Management System which can help control all your yard operations remotely and in real time. It allows you to get real-time locations of trucks, trailers, and even your drivers giving the picture at the ground level.

Industrial IoT (IIoT)
Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)
The next wave of revolution for industries is going to come in the form of Internet of Things. The entire world is having this word understood better in an attempt to respond better to this eventuality.
What is the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)?
Internet of Things
is rather simple to understand. All the items currently which are electronically non connected e.g. an electrical device that does not have any form of electronic connectivity to other devices, not gets to make their presence felt in the electronic world and networks like the internet. Now this when extended to Industrial appliances, machines makes up the world of Industrial IoT.
What are the examples of IoT?
The common examples we find in everyday life like a refrigerator which is internet connected and able to reply or react/quick to respond to commands from mobile application. Industrial IoT has more complex iiot solutions where in the devices like machines running on the shop floor are connected to command and data center where smart machine learning based algos crunch the data from these devices. The mass production is now going to go through a digital transformation of sorts
What are the benefits of Industrial IoT?
The core purpose of Industrial IoT deployments are operational efficiency and cost-efficiency. Manufacturing operations seems to be the major place for the current IoT spends. Typical use cases of IoT are that of preemptive maintenance e.g. a customer can be provided with a notification that machine is showing signs of wear and tear and it needs replace of a specific part. It is difficult many times to come up with quantitative and tangible benefits. Some of the use cases the benefits are very obvious are the use cases like if there is the sudden temperature in some remote location in the plant and this immediate attention, use case of sending remote notifications to those onshore if there are issues in some underwater industrial robotic arm malfunctioning.
What are the current challenges with Industrial IoT?
Some of the major challenges which companies are facing with regard to IoT are that of huge amount of data and the variety of data, lack of skills and security. These aspects are crucial for building sufficient traction towards bigger and more implementations of IoT.
What is the impact of Industrial IoT (IIoT) on the future of Manufacturing?
The manufacturing industry is going to see a sea of change. Concepts like Industry 4.0 are making inroads with the help of IoT. The IoT applications and devices together are going to be providing various valuable insights which were earlier not available. With these insights, one expects that the operational efficiency is going to drastically improve. The entire supply chain is bound to change with IoT influence. The IoT is going to impact, how maintenance is undertaken – now it is going to more of predictive maintenance instead of just preventive maintenance. Thus the Industrial IoT applications are many and their use cases are going to increase with more innovations. These IoT devices are going to provide real-time visibility to the world of things which was never possible before. Intelligent solutions build around these devices are bound to make the customer experience better and business outcomes more predictable.
How can Industrial IoT impact your bottomline and future?
The obvious question that one would like to know, how will it impact our business. This is a question more from the point of view getting a more personalized understanding of the impact.

Video MER – More intelligence with Savings
Video MER, or Video based Medical Examination Report, is a process in which insurance companies use video technology to remotely conduct medical examinations for applicants or proposers, using qualified medical professionals. This can be done through the use of video conferencing tools.
Insurance companies may use Video MER to reduce costs and improve efficiency by eliminating the need for in-person medical exams. It can also be used to quickly assess the medical condition of an applicant, which can help the company make informed decisions about coverage and sums assured.
Video MER can be especially useful for insurance companies that need to review medical exams for applicants or proposers, who are located in remote or underserved areas, or who have mobility or transportation issues that make it difficult for them to attend an in-person exam.
How effective is Video MER against Physical MER?
Video Medical Exam Report (Video MER) and Physical Medical Exam Report (Physical MER) are both methods that insurance companies use to conduct medical examinations on applicants aspiring to get insured. Both methods can be effective in certain situations, but it is important to consider the specific needs and circumstances of the policyholder or applicant when deciding which method to use.
One advantage of Video MER is that it allows insurance companies to review medical exams remotely, which can be more convenient and accessible for policyholders or applicants who are located in remote or underserved areas, or who have mobility or transportation issues. Video MER can also help to reduce the risk of exposure to infectious diseases by eliminating the need for in-person visits.
On the other hand, Physical MER may be necessary in situations where a more thorough and in-depth examination is required. For example, if a policyholder or applicant has a complex medical condition that requires a hands-on examination or specialized testing, Physical MER may be more appropriate.
In general, the effectiveness of Video MER versus Physical MER will depend on the specific needs and circumstances of the policyholder or applicant, as well as the medical condition being evaluated. Insurance companies should carefully consider these factors when deciding which method to use for reviewing medical exams.
Does Video MER help prevent the nexus between the medical professional and the proposer?
Video Medical Examination Report (Video MER) can help to reduce the potential for a nexus between a medical professional and a proposer by eliminating the need for in-person medical exams. In a Video MER process, the proposert can participate in the medical exam remotely, using a telemedicine platform or other video conferencing tool. This can help to prevent the medical professional and proposer from having direct contact, which can reduce the risk of any potential conflict of interest or influence.
It is important to note, however, that while Video MER can help to reduce the potential for a nexus between a phlebotomist and a proposer, it may not completely eliminate the risk. Insurance companies should carefully review the policies and procedures they have in place to ensure that the medical exam review process is fair, impartial, and objective.
Can recordings of video MER’s help insurance companies offer lower premiums and higher sum assured?
Video MER can also help insurance companies to make more informed decisions about coverage by providing a more comprehensive view of the policyholder or proposer’s medical condition. By reviewing medical exams in real time, insurance companies can ask questions and gather additional information as needed, which can help to provide a more accurate assessment of the policyholder or applicant’s health.
In some cases, the use of Video MER may allow insurance companies to offer lower premiums and higher sum assured to policyholders or applicants. However, the specific impact on premiums and sum assured will depend on a variety of factors, including the policyholder or proposer’s medical history, age, lifestyle, and other risk factors. Ultimately, the goal of Video MER is to provide a more efficient and effective way for insurance companies to review medical exams, rather than to directly impact premiums and sum assured.
So, would insurance companies need to store the recordings?
It is common for insurance companies to store the recordings of Video Medical Examination Reports (Video MERs) as part of their records and documentation. These recordings could then be used as a reference for future evaluations and decisions related to coverage and sums assured.
There is also a legal or regulatory requirement by IRDA (
Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India
) that mandates the retention of Video MER recordings, for a period of three years.
In addition to any legal or regulatory requirements, insurance companies may choose to store Video MER recordings for their own internal purposes, such as for quality control, training, or to support future decisions about coverage and sums assured.
It is important for insurance companies to carefully manage the storage and retention of Video MER recordings in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations, as well as their own policies and procedures. This can help to ensure the privacy and security of policyholders and applicants, as well as the integrity and reliability of the insurance company’s records.
Do Insurance Companies benefit from Video MER, and how?
Insurance Companies can benefit from Video Medical Exam Review (Video MER) in a number of ways. Some potential benefits of Video MER for underwriters include:
Increased efficiency:
Video MER allows them to review medical exams remotely, which can save time and reduce the need for in-person visits. This can help to improve the efficiency of the underwriting process.
Improved accuracy:
By reviewing medical exams in real time, doctors can ask questions and gather additional information as needed, which can help to provide a more accurate assessment of a policyholder or applicant’s health.
Reduced costs:
Video MER can help to reduce the costs associated with conducting in-person medical exams, such as travel expenses, facility rentals, and other logistics.
Greater convenience:
Video MER can be more convenient for policyholders or applicants who are located in remote or underserved areas, or who have mobility or transportation issues.
Reduced risk of exposure to infectious diseases:
By reviewing medical exams remotely, underwriters can reduce the risk of exposure to infectious diseases, which can be especially important during times of pandemic or other public health emergencies.
Improve
Medical Underwriting
by including MER Checks?
The significance of
MER checks
lies in their ability to uphold the integrity and precision of medical underwriting. AI-driven solutions revolutionize this process by ensuring comprehensive and meticulous evaluations of Medical Examination Reports. These AI technologies, by analyzing extensive data and utilizing advanced algorithms, can detect discrepancies, authenticate information, and validate health status more efficiently than traditional methods.
Advantages of AI-enhanced MER checks:
Higher accuracy in identifying health discrepancies.
Reduced manual errors and biases.
Faster processing and analysis of medical data.
Consistency across different reports and cases.
Enhanced ability to detect potential fraud or misinformation.
Leveraging AI for MER checks significantly benefits both insurance companies and policyholders by providing a more accurate and efficient review process.
How important is Face Match during a Medical Examination?
Comparing the face in an identity proof to the face in a video during a Video Medical Exam Report (Video MER) can help to reduce the risk of identity fraud. By verifying the identity of the policyholder or applicant through a face match, insurance companies can confirm that the person participating in the Video MER is indeed the individual whose identity has been provided.
However, it is important to note that a face match alone may not be sufficient to completely prevent identity fraud. There are a number of other steps that insurance companies can take to reduce the risk of identity fraud, such as verifying the authenticity of identity documents, checking for red flags or inconsistencies in the information provided, and using other identity verification methods such as biometric authentication.
Can a Video Examination detect Heart Rate?
QuicSolv’s video conferencing solution – Remolin, has the ability to detect heart rate in real time using the proposer’s camera to capture images of the face and then analyzing the changes in the size of the blood vessels in the face as the heart beats.
The technique works by tracking the movement of the blood vessels in the face and measuring the changes in their size as the heart pumps blood through the body. This information is then used to calculate the heart rate. This can be a useful feature for insurance companies that are conducting Video Medical Exam Reviews (Video MERs) as part of the underwriting or sums assured process.
Can Heart Rate be used a tool to detect underlying Medical issues?
The idea of using heart rate as a tool during investigations is based on the understanding that anxiety and stress can affect a person’s heart rate, and monitoring changes in heart rate can potentially reveal important information about a person’s emotional state.
During an investigation, an investigator may use various techniques to induce stress or anxiety in a person in order to elicit a specific response. By monitoring the person’s heart rate in real time, the investigator can see how the person is responding physiologically to different lines of questioning or stimuli.
For example, if the person’s heart rate spikes significantly in response to a particular question or topic, the investigator may infer that the person is feeling anxious or stressed about that topic. This information can then be used to adjust the questioning strategy in real time, in order to either ease the person’s anxiety or to further explore the topic that is causing the emotional response.
It’s worth noting that heart rate alone cannot be relied upon as conclusive evidence of deception or guilt, as many factors can influence a person’s heart rate. However, when used in conjunction with other investigative techniques and tools, real-time heart rate monitoring can provide valuable insights into a person’s emotional state and help guide questioning strategy.
Geo-tagging and Geo-fencing
Geo tagging and geo fencing can be powerful tools for insurance companies operating in high-risk areas in India. Geo tagging involves adding location information to digital media, while geo fencing creates virtual boundaries around specific locations using GPS or RFID technology.
By using these tools during video calls, insurance companies can verify the location of the call and tailor insurance policies based on the location. For example, they can offer higher coverage for calls taking place in high-risk areas, and detect fraudulent activity to reduce the risk of fraudulent claims.
To enable geo tagging and geo fencing during video calls, GPS data is embedded in video calling apps. The accuracy of geo fencing varies depending on the technology and conditions under which it is used, with GPS typically being the most accurate. By carefully implementing geo tagging and geo fencing during video calls, insurance companies can better assess risk, verify claims, and improve customer experience without compromising individuals’ privacy or security.
